Tom Anderson restoration and customization.

This was an awesome restoration. After sitting in a barn for nearly 30 years it was tough to restore this one but it was well worth it in the end.

This was a super cool project that we got to take this already wildly engraved instrument to the next level we hand cut these three angels and then leave them into the fretboard
