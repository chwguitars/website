This was a cool build that found its way overseas to Europe although we normally manufacture all of our own neck. It was a pleasure to incorporate a carbon fiber/graphite neck made by Status. The body is made from ash to really bring out the sustain. It is equipped with incredible 18v Bartolini electronics to really bring out the traditional Music Man tone. Finally we incorporated hipshot saddles and a custom rear plate proudly displaying Made in USA.
